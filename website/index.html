                    Hello! My name is William, and I am a first year student at the 
                    <label>University of Western Ontario.</label> I am currently exploring 
                    my interests through participating in case competitions and 
                    hackathons! I've recently acquired an interest in web development 
                    and I have learned machine learning concepts on my own.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At university, I am partaking in a variety of extracurriculars
                    ranging from an artificial intelligence club to a dragon boat 
                    team. Addtionally, I am working on projects to develop my skills 
                    as a computer science student.
